The suite has six variants which test various instructions:

1. Full - tests all flags and registers.
2. Doc - tests all registers but only officially documented flags.
3. Flags - tests all flags, ignores registers.
4. DocFlags - tests documented flags only, ignores registers.
5. Ccf - tests all flags after executing CCF after each instruction tested.
6. Memptr - tests all flags after executing BIT N, (HL) after each instruction tested.

Two versions of the test suite are currently included, 1.0 and 1.2a.
