# Mark Woodmass' Tests

[Program-based](Z80.md#program-test-suites) tests that Mark Woodmass posted on the World of Spectrum forums in 2008 to test his MEMPTR implementation.

## Details

The suite has two variants:

1. Flags - tests the documented and undocumented flags of various instructions.
2. MEMPTR - tests the internal WZ or MEMPTR register after various instructions.

## Original Tests

The original tests can be found at [](https://worldofspectrum.org/forums/discussion/20345). Copyright © 2008 Mark Woodmass.
No licence was included. However, they were posted freely on a public forum for others to use, so I believe it is fine to include them here.

The tests require the ZX Spectrum 48k ROM. ZX Spectrum ROMs are included. Amstrad have given their permission to distribute the ROM;
